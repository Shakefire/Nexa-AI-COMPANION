    <h1 align="center">📱 Nexa 📱</h1>
</p>

You get **Nexa**, a Whatsapp agent that can engage with users in a "realistic" way, inspired by the great film [Ex Machina](https://www.imdb.com/es-es/title/tt0470752/). Ok, you won't find a fully sentient robot here, but you **will** have some pretty interesting Whatsapp conversations.

>You can think of it as a modern reinterpretation of the Turing Test 🤣

Nexa is capable of:
* Receiving and sending Whatsapp messages 📲
* Understanding your voice 🗣️
* Recognizing your images 🖼️
* Sending voice notes back 🎤
* Sharing updates about its "daily activities" 🚣
* Sending you images of its current activities 🖼️
